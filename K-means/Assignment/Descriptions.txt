For the implementation part, you will be using the Titanic dataset (available here).
 Before proceeding with it, I would like to discuss some facts about the data itself. 
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. 
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an
 iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked 
the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not
 enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck
 involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive 
than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

Now, talking about the dataset, the training set contains several records about the
 passengers of Titanic (hence the name of the dataset). It has 12 features capturing
 information about passenger_class, port_of_Embarkation, passenger_fare etc. 
The dataset's label is survival which denotes the survivial status of a particular 
passenger. Your task is to cluster the records into two i.e. the ones who survived
 and the ones who did not.

You might be thinking that since it is a labeled dataset, how could it be used for a 
clustering task? You just have to drop the 'survival' column from the dataset and make 
it unlabeled. It's the task of K-Means to cluster the records of the datasets if they
 survived or not.
